# [Puzhukkeni] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [DoubleTrouble]


### Team Members
[Vishnu Nandan] - [Christ College of Engineering]
[Rohan K Sojo] - [Christ College of College]

### Project Description
A completely over-engineered alarm clock where you must win a frantic mini-game to stop the alarm. Wake up by tapping worms before greedy virtual birds snatch them away ‚Äî every snooze makes the game harder.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People have mastered the art of hitting snooze without even opening their eyes.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
You can‚Äôt stop the alarm unless you beat the birds in a worm-catching game. The birds get faster each time you snooze. All while a Malayalam uncle roasts you for being lazy.
